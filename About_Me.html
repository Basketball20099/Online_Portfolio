            <!-- Paragraph 1 -->
            <p>
                [Career Goal] Since I was young, I wanted to be like my dad. That's where my career goals came from. I always wanted to go deeper into Computer Science. My goal is to become a Web Developer. My plan for this is to go to a good college that is very Computer science based. For example UC Berkeley. My reason for wanting all of this also is because I want to be well-paid so that I can support my family
            </p>




            <!-- Paragraph 2 -->
            <p>
                [Strengths and Personal Qualities] I work very well in team settings as well as alone. I work hard, and whenever there is something to be done, I try my hardest to get it done as soon as possible. I also have experience with some languages for example, python, html, and javascript. I also enjoy learning about the components of a computers hardware. My other characteristics would include being curious and teachable.
            </p>




            <!-- Paragraph 3 -->
            <p>
                [Important Achievements and Abilities] I have many non Computer Science related achievments. This includes getting third place and an honorable mention in two piano competitions I've participated in. Piano has been one of my passions for about seven years. On top of this, I have played basketball since I was ten. I've played on multiple teams on many different leagues. Most recently, I played on my high school team for freshman basketball. I have been balancing these two activities along with getting solid grades. I have learned many things about myself from all the challenges I've been through. For example, when I was in 7th grade, I did my first math course over the summer. Going into this, I thought it would be a piece of cake. I soon realized that I had to step it up if I wanted to pass. From that experience, I learned that with proper efforts, anything can be achieved. I learned about myself that I was willing to do anything for my goals.
            </p>




            <!-- Conclusion -->
            <p>
                [Conclusion] To sum up, I am a very tough-nosed person who can take criticism and improve from it. I don't have too big of an ego to prevent me from getting better. For me, there is nothing for satisfying than improving at something drastically. I am a very caring person as well, I would do anything to complete my goals and support my family.
