        <h2>AMVA Study App</h2>
        <p>Course: Computer Science Essentials</p>
        <p>Date: 5/15/2024</p>
        <p>Description: The AMVA study app is an interactive study application where the user can plot future tests, or events during the week. The user also has a study page available with a timer, stopwatch, and music for the user to listen too while working. In this project, My javascript knowledge improved exponentially. This was one of the few times I have ever used the language, so I was able to learn a lot from my group mates. I worked as product tester, debugger, and I worked a little on some aspects of the User Interface. I was also assigned the task of documentation and the slides. </p>

        <h2>Project 1.1.6 App Development: Creative Expression</h2>
        <p>Course: Computer Science Essentials</p>
        <p>Date: 11/1/2023</p>
        <p>Description: The app was an interactive adventure game based on the user's choices. It was fantasy based. The game also contained a dice roling mechanism, which could influence the user's adventure. To create this project, me and my partner used Python, which I was already comfortable with. This project taught me to be able to assign parts of an assignment to a group. After this project, splitting up work became easier in group projects. I worked on the main part of the code, while my partner worked on the dice mechanism.</p>
